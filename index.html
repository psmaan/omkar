            <p>This the perfect example of tracking sun Light to have the best Solar efficiency in which we traced the position of sun by using ardino. This helped a lot of people as while installation solar panel they were fixed due to which the best out of sun was not utilised. As the project was introduced , it helped by tracking and gathering as much solar energy as possible.</p>

            <h3>Calculation of Tax collection on Toll Tax plazas</h3>
            <p>We used an algorithm to determine the presence of any approaching vehicle. As soon as thw presence was detected by the sensors, the gates were closed and opened only after the successfull collection of toll tax via any online secured gateway payment method.</p>
